Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
   Melisa Brown

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
   mochiswebforge.site	

3. What's the URL of your git repo?
   https://github.com/brownmelisa/elixir-practice

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
   Completed the palindrome and the test. Did not completely finish 
   the factor or the calculate. I can deploy the site using the 
   start.sh and the deploy.sh scripts, but could not get the service
   to work.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
   No. The deploy.sh and start.sh work, but not the service.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
   Still struggling to understand how to deal with loops that don't 
   involve lists, since map and Enum involve sets. 

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
   The deployment was the most frustrating. I spent hours going
   through the phoenix documentation to try to get the service to 
   work. I ended up running out of time with the coding.
