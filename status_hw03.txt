Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
   Melisa Brown

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
   mochiswebforge.site	

3. What's the URL of your git repo?
   https://github.com/brownmelisa/elixir-practice

4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
   Completed the palindrome. The math on the factor is correct, 
   but it still failed one test because of pattern matching
   and the result is not displaying on the web. I did not
   implement the order of operations portion of the calc function
   because I didn't completely understand how you wanted us to 
   implement the postfix and prefix.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
   Yes, I got to deploy, but the answer to the factor page
   is not displaying.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
   Still struggling to understand how to deal with loops that don't 
   involve lists, since map and Enum involve sets. The syntax is 
   a struggle. 

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
   The deployment was the most frustrating.
